The previous AI engineer initiated the development of booq, a social book discovery platform, as a Next.js frontend application. Initially, the plan was full-stack, prioritizing Google Books API integration. However, following the user's explicit instruction to only focus on the front end development, the engineer pivoted to building a visually stunning UI using mock data. The work commenced with setting up the foundational Next.js structure, integrating the specified design system (Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui), and acquiring book cover images. Subsequently, core UI components like , , , , , , , and  were created. Missing shadcn components (, , ) were installed and generated. The current state is a well-structured frontend scaffold with key components in place, awaiting further population with interactive mock data and functional enhancements. The last action was a successful server restart to validate component integration and syntax.

<product_requirements>
The booq application aims to be a social book discovery platform on Next.js, leveraging friend recommendations and community interactions over traditional cataloging. The project is phased: Phase 1 (Core Functionality) includes user authentication, book discovery, personal library management, and rating/review. Phase 2 (Enhanced Social) adds social feed, friend discovery, and reading challenges. Phase 3 (Community Building) introduces book clubs.

Design-wise, it draws inspiration from Netflix (carousels, recommendations), Letterboxd (cover-focused grids, typography), Spotify (playlist-like collections, discovery algorithms), Instagram (social feed), and Discord (community features). A detailed design system specifies warm/inviting light mode and cozy dark mode color palettes, typography (Crimson Text, Inter, Playfair Display), and layout principles emphasizing cover art, whitespace, responsiveness, and subtle animations. Cross-device compatibility includes specific breakpoints and optimizations for mobile (single/two-column, touch-optimized), tablet (three-column, sidebar overlay), and desktop (four+ columns, persistent sidebar).

The current implementation focuses solely on the frontend (Phase 1) due to user instruction, building out the UI components with mock data to achieve an early aha moment of the visual experience.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Next.js**: Primary framework for building the frontend, enabling server/client components.
-   **React**: Core library for UI development.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling, integrated with a custom design system.
-   **shadcn/ui**: Component library providing pre-styled, accessible UI elements.
-   **Google Books API**: Initially planned for book data integration, but deferred due to user's frontend-only focus.
-   **Mock Data**: Used for populating UI components in the absence of a live API.

*   :
    *   **Importance**: The main entry point for the application's home page. It orchestrates the display of various content sections.
    *   **Changes**: Implemented to render the core UI components like , , and , providing the initial user experience with mock data.
*   :
    *   **Importance**: Handles all backend API requests via Next.js API routes.
    *   **Changes**: Initially structured for MongoDB and potentially Google Books API. Currently serves as a placeholder or contains basic mock data endpoints, as backend integration was paused.
*   :
    *   **Importance**: The main application container responsible for responsive layout, adaptive sidebar, global search, user quick actions, and theme toggle.
    *   **Changes**: Newly created to encapsulate the core UI layout as per the  component architecture.
*   :
    *   **Importance**: Displays personalized book recommendations and trending content, expected to feature horizontal scrolling carousels.
    *   **Changes**: Newly created to structure the discovery sections for books, populated with mock data.
*   :
    *   **Importance**: A versatile component for displaying individual book information in various layouts (compact, standard, featured, social).
    *   **Changes**: Newly created as the fundamental visual unit for books, designed for a cover-first approach with mock data.
*   :
    *   **Importance**: Provides a global search functionality with expected features like autocomplete and advanced filters.
    *   **Changes**: Newly created as the search input component for the application.
*   :
    *   **Importance**: Displays a timeline of social activity from friends, such as reading updates and reviews.
    *   **Changes**: Newly created to structure and present mock social activity data.
*   :
    *   **Importance**: Showcases social review discovery and interaction.
    *   **Changes**: Newly created to display mock user reviews, likely with interaction elements.
*   :
    *   **Importance**: Provides comprehensive information for a selected book, including social context, reviews, and discussions.
    *   **Changes**: Newly created to define the detailed view of a book, populated with mock data.
*   :
    *   **Importance**: Offers a quick, overlay preview of book details without navigating away from the current page.
    *   **Changes**: Newly created to provide a modal for quick mock book previews.
*   , , :
    *   **Importance**: These are shadcn/ui components, providing pre-built UI primitives that were missing and required by the custom components.
    *   **Changes**: Newly created (generated) and added to the  directory, and their corresponding dependencies were installed via yarn install v1.22.22
